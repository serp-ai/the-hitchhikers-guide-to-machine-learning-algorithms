# Machine Learning for Humans

Hello humans & welcome to the world of machines.

Specifically, machine learning & algorithms.

We are about to embark on an exciting adventure through the vast and varied landscape of algorithms that power the cutting-edge field of artificial intelligence.

Machine learning is changing the world as we know it. 

From predicting stock market trends and diagnosing diseases to powering the virtual assistants in our smartphones and enabling self-driving cars, and picking up the slack on your online dating conversations.

What makes this book unique is its structure and depth. With 100 chapters, each dedicated to a different machine learning concept, this book is designed to be your ultimate guide to the world of machine learning algorithms.

The print version is ... well, printed and so we will not be mailing you new pages to tape into the binding as we write them. But the online digital version will be continually updated, forever. Maybe by humans, and maybe by machines when humans are gone.

You can find it at online. Probably at [SERP AI](https://serp.ai/).

Whether you are a student, a data science professional, or someone curious about machine learning, this book aims to provide a comprehensive overview that is both accessible and in-depth.

The algorithms covered in this book span various categories including:

- Classification & Regression: Learn about algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression which are used to classify data or predict numerical values.
- Clustering: Discover algorithms like k-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN that group data points together based on similarities.
- Neural Networks & Deep Learning: Dive into algorithms and architectures like Perceptrons, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM).
- Optimization: Understand algorithms like Gradient Descent, Genetic Algorithms, and Particle Swarm Optimization which find the best possible solutions in different scenarios.
- Ensemble Methods: Explore algorithms like AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Random Forests which combine the predictions of multiple models for improved accuracy.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Learn about algorithms like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) which reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining important information.
- Reinforcement Learning: Get to know algorithms like Q-learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Monte Carlo Tree Search which are used in systems that learn from their environment.


Each chapter is designed as a standalone introduction to its respective algorithm. This means you can start from any chapter that catches your interest or proceed sequentially. Along with the theory, practical examples, applications, and insights into how these algorithms work under the hood are provided.

This book is not just an academic endeavor but a bridge that connects theory with practical real-world applications. 

It's an invitation to explore, learn, and harness the power of algorithms to solve complex problems and make informed decisions.

Fasten your seat belts as we dive into the mesmerizing world of machine learning algorithms. 

Whether you are looking to expand your knowledge, seeking inspiration, or in pursuit of technical mastery, this book should sit on your coffee table and make you look intelligent in front of all invited (and uninvited) guests.
